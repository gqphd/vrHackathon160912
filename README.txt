For reader's concerned,
Folders such as 'Easy Movie Texture' [1], 'OVR'[2], 'Vuforia'[3], 'GoogleVR'[4] and its corresponding files are removed intentionally. You can find that file after downloading on your own, and after purchasing one([1]) in unity asset store.
And large video files in assetstore are intentionally deleted also due to github's large file policy[5]. Ask developer to get those files. That files can be provided with Dropbox link if necessary.
